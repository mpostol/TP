## 1.3. Executive Summary

In this short video, I present an executive summary (3 min) of the Programming in Practice educational path. To get more, consider enrolling in [Programming in Practice - Executive Summary; free Udemy course][udemyPiPES]; This free course explains the role of this repository as a collection of extended examples that is a foundation for the `Programming in Practice` paradigm. The course is for all serious about improving the software development skills education methodology including but not limited to teachers and lecturers wanting to improve the software development skills education methodology. It is all about engineering atop University knowledge and practical experience as a foundation. Press the play button to open the video on `YouTube`.

## 1.4. Repository Content

### 1.4.1. Preface

> **Programming in Practice** is a contribution to **Code Engineering**. Code Engineering, also known as programming, is the process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining computer programs. It involves applying engineering principles and methodologies to writing the program text, also referred to as the code to ensure its reliability, efficiency, and scalability. Code engineering encompasses various stages, including requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance, all aimed at producing high-quality computer software that meets the needs of users or clients.
> The **main goal** of this repository is to turn today's students into tomorrow's advanced software developers and architects.
> The **main purpose** of this repository is to provide code extended examples for education purposes.

My point is that we could distinguish between two kinds of education:

1. **learning** - focused on knowledge (concepts, standards, best practices, etc) adoption
1. **training** - focused on product deployment

The extended examples gathered in this repository focus on learning - the improvement of your knowledge related to software engineering as a field of computer science covering topics like the systematic design, development, testing, maintenance, and evolution of software. My goal is that it will be beneficial for you in the long run. The extended examples have been selected and prepared considering that **simplification is not a mother of simplicity**

The code extended examples address the following application domains:

- [**Information Computation (IC)**](InformationComputation/README.md): internal data management - all about engaging a computer (a physical device) to process information as a series of actions or steps taken to achieve a particular result or help to fulfill a task.
- [**External Data Management (ExDM)**](ExDataManagement/README.md): external (streaming, structural, graphical) data management -  all about processing data managed using external resources, that is screen, DBMS (database management system), files.
- [**Adaptive Programming (AP)**](AdaptiveProgramming/README.md): language constructs, patterns, and frameworks used at the development and deployment stage to improve the future adaptability of the software.
- [**Concurrent Programming (CW)**](ConcurrentProgramming/README.md): all about the programming pattern formally describing a program to execute operations as a result of nondeterministic events at run time.
- [**Distributed Programming (DP)**](DistributedProgramming/README.md): all about developing inter-operable applications interconnected over the network.

The TP repository collects examples that can serve as a pattern with the broadest possible applicability addressing the applications in concern. All topics are illustrated using the C# language and the MS Visual Studio design environment to ensure the practical context and provide solid examples.

The source code is available under a very permissive open-source license to increase broad reach. Hopefully, the samples are easily portable to other development environments.

### 1.4.2. Information Computation (IC)

Information Computation means a process engaging a computer (a physical device) to process information as a series of actions or steps taken to achieve a particular result or help to fulfill a task. The main challenge is that information is abstract. Precisely speaking, it is a kind of knowledge that cannot be processed directly by any physical device. The repository contains code that is to be used as a set of examples for an online video course and class lectures. The examples can also be used alone. Generally speaking, two main topics are covered. The first one refers to selected aspects of information modeling using types as descendants of a coding system.  The second one covers program architecture design patterns to improve the design and deployment of the computer behavior description using a program implementing an algorithm.

The [InformationComputation](InformationComputation/README.md) folder collects examples that can serve as a certain pattern with the broadest possible applicability addressing the mentioned above application domain.

> **Note**: to open the code samples in the Visual Studio double click the file `InformationComputation`.

### 1.4.3. External Data Management (ExDM)

Computer science in general, and especially software development, is a field of knowledge that deals with the automation of information processing. Programs can be recognized as a recipe for that automated behavior. To achieve information processing goals programs have to manage external information engaged to control the graphical user interface (graphical data), stored by database management systems (structure data) and file systems (streaming data). This part of the gathered examples provides ready-to-use code snippets helpful for rendering the graphical data, querying the structural data, and serialization to employ streaming data, that is manage of the external data. The external data is recognized as a process information representation handled outside of the program realm.

The [ExDataManagement](ExDataManagement/README.md) folder collects examples that can serve as examples of managing external data.

> **Note**: to open the code samples in the Visual studio double click the file `ExDataManagement`.

### 1.4.4. Adaptive Programming (AP)

The adaptive programming is presented as a catalog of language constructs, patterns, and frameworks used at the development and deployment stage to increase the adaptability of the program against changing production environment in which it is executed.

The [AdaptiveProgramming](AdaptiveProgramming/README.md) folder collects examples that can serve as a certain pattern with the broadest possible applicability addressing the adaptive programming.

> **Note**: to open the code samples in the Visual studio double click the file `AdaptiveProgramming`.

### 1.4.5. Concurrent Programming (CW)

It is a programming paradigm that allows writing a program that formally describes the execution of instructions as a result of nondeterministic events. Concurrency is when multiple sequences of instructions are run in overlapping periods. In other words, the instructions sequence execution is undetermined in advance. Concurrency may be implemented explicitly using constructs like the Thread type, or implicitly using a concept like asynchronous programming. The gathered examples address selected concepts unique for concurrent programming, namely critical section, race condition, synchronization, communication, and deadlocks, to name only the most important.

The [ConcurrentProgramming](ConcurrentProgramming/README.md) folder collects examples that can serve as a certain pattern with the broadest possible applicability addressing the mentioned above application domain.

> **Note**: to open the code samples in the Visual studio double click the file `ConcurrentProgramming`.

### 1.4.6. Distributed Programming (DP)

Information and Communication Technology has provided society with a vast diversity of distributed applications. By design, the deployment of this kind of application has to focus primarily on communication. Examples collected in this repository address the systematic approach to the designing of meaningful Machine to Machine (M2M) communication targeting distributed mobile applications in the context of new emerging disciplines, namely Industry 4.0 and Internet of Things (IoT) atop of the M2M communication and composed as multi-vendor cyber-physicals systems.

The [DistributedProgramming](DistributedProgramming/README.md) folder collects examples that can be reused in any case distributed processing of information is considered.
